# 📘 Smart Study Material Classifier

## 📌 Project Description
The Smart Study Material Classifier is a Machine Learning based application that automatically
classifies uploaded study material PDFs into academic subjects such as **Math, Operating Systems (OS),
Database Management Systems (DBMS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract and preprocess text from
PDF files and applies a **Naive Bayes classification model** to predict the most relevant subject
along with a confidence score.

## Confidence Score Logic

Naive Bayes models tend to produce conservative probability estimates when trained on limited
datasets. To address this, the confidence score is calculated using relative probability dominance
between the top two predicted classes, providing a more meaningful confidence representation.
